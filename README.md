# FROM NAND TO TETRIS - BUILD A MODERN COMPUTER

In this course, you will take a self-paced journey through building a computer from the ground up, starting with Boolean algebra and logic gates and ending with a fully functional general-purpose computer. You will learn about hardware abstractions, implement them yourself, and ultimately experience the thrill of building a complex system. Each folder contains my own solutions to the assignments and my personal notes:

- Project 1: Building basic logic gates like And, Or, Not, and Multiplexor
- Project 2: Building a range of adder chips and an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Project 3: Building registers, memory units, and a Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Project 4: Learning a machine language and writing low-level programs
- Project 5: Using the chipset from projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of running programs in the machine language from project 4
- Project 6: Developing an assembler to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary code.
